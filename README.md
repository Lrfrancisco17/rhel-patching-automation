Infrastructure Automation: 

Terraform + Ansible (RHEL & Ubuntu)
This repository provides a complete, end‑to‑end automation stack that deploys:

*	Ansible Controller Node
*	RHEL 10 Managed Node
*	Ubuntu Managed Node

All infrastructure is created using Terraform, and all configuration, patching, and rollback operations are handled by Ansible. Each server is bootstrapped with a default Ansible user, SSH keys, and passwordless sudo via cloud-init, enabling immediate automation with no manual steps.

Project Goals:

*	Deploy multi‑OS infrastructure automatically
*	Configure passwordless automation using a dedicated Ansible user
*	Provide a unified Ansible playbook for Patching RHEL & Ubuntu
*	Rolling back patches (OS‑specific logic)
*	Maintain a clean, modular, production‑ready repo structure
*	Support GitLab CI/CD for validation and deployment
